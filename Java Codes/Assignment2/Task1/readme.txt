javac SHA.java

java SHA

the program will run and display 

HashCode Generated by SHA-1 for:

The Cat-In-The-Hat owes [Chong] 1 dollars : dd1

The Cat-In-The-Hat owes [Chong] 11702 dollars : dd1

When x: $1 and y: $11702 the same hash is produced

This will show that the encryption method SHA-1 will display the same last 24bits when the string is 1 and 11702, this shows that the encryption is insecure as multiple 
inputs can get the same output.
