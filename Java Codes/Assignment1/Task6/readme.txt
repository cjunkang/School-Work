after working at it for around 15hours, the gf2p8 is still unable to work properly
it has gal8 mult and subbytes and mixcolumns but the conversion for a1a2a3a4 into a code that can be used for mixcolumns is unable to work
since -25%/day its more logical to submit this work and -4 marks than take a 25% reduction.
